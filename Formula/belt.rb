      Wire belt into ~/.claude/settings.json — the event argument is belt's
      guard event (lowercase), not the Claude Code tool name:

        "hooks": {
          "PreToolUse": [
            {"matcher": "Bash",
             "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "belt hook bash"}]},
            {"matcher": "Write|Edit",
             "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "belt hook write"}]}
          ]
        }

      Hook changes take effect in the next Claude Code session.
